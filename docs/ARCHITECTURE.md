## Overview

WeHive will be a cutting-edge real estate investment platform that simplifies property investment through tokenization. By abstracting blockchain complexities, the platform allows users to create accounts, complete KYC, and invest without needing to understand or interact directly with blockchain technologies.

---

## Business Objectives

- **User Simplicity:** Offer a seamless onboarding process with simple account creation, KYC verification, and a familiar investing experience.
- **Transparency & Security:** Provide immutable record-keeping through blockchain while ensuring all transactions are auditable and secure.
- **Cost Efficiency & Scalability:** Dynamically select between Polygon (for low-cost transactions) and Solana (for high throughput) to optimize operations.
- **Real-Time Engagement:** Deliver live updates and notifications via a dedicated WebSocket server for a responsive user experience.

## Mobile Application

The mobile app provides the primary user interface, with the following modules:

- **Registration & KYC Upload:** Users sign up and upload identity documents.
- **Marketplace Exploration:** Browse tokenized property listings.
- **Portfolio Dashboard:** View and manage investments.
- **Notifications & Live Updates:** Receive real-time alerts regarding transactions and property statuses.
- **Wallet Integration (Abstracted):** Although wallet operations occur under the hood, users interact with a simple account-based system.

---

## API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the front door for all client requests. It:

- Authenticates requests using OAuth2/JWT.
- Applies rate limiting and throttling to ensure stability.
- Logs and monitors incoming requests.
- Implements failover mechanisms for high availability.

---

## Core Business Logic

This layer coordinates and orchestrates all operations on the platform:

- **User Management & KYC:** Handles profile management and identity verification.
- **Marketplace & Token Purchase Manager:** Processes token purchase requests.
- **Portfolio Management:** Maintains and displays user investments.
- **Tax Export Module:** Generates tax reports in PDF/CSV format.
- **Transaction Logging & Audit Trails:** Logs all transactions and operations for compliance.
- **Notification Triggers & Fraud Detection:** Manages real-time updates and monitors for suspicious activities.
- **Event-Driven Messaging:** Utilizes Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.

---

## Blockchain Abstraction & Integration

The WeHive platform uses an abstraction layer to hide blockchain details. This layer provides a unified API for token minting, transfers, and payout processing.

### Blockchain Choices

- **Polygon (Primary):**
  - **Low Transaction Fees:** Ideal for microtransactions and frequent token minting.
  - **Ethereum Compatibility:** Supports ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards.
  - **Robust Ecosystem:** Mature tooling and developer support.
- **Solana (Secondary):**
  - **High Throughput:** Capable of handling thousands of transactions per second.
  - **Low Latency:** Fast confirmation times for real-time applications.
  - **Cost Efficiency:** Suitable for bulk operations and high-speed processing.

### Smart Contract Development & Integration

- **On Polygon:** Use EVM-based smart contracts (ERC-20 for fractional ownership or ERC-721 for unique tokens).
- **On Solana:** Develop programs in Rust (using frameworks like Anchor) to provide similar functionalities.

## External Providers

- **Payment Providers:** Integrate with Stripe, PayPal, or Klarna for fiat transactions and payouts.
- **KYC Providers:** Use Jumio, Onfido, or similar services for identity verification.
- **Other Services:** Integrate with audit and logging services for enhanced monitoring.

---

## Real-Time Communication & Administration

- **WebSocket Server:** Pushes live updates and notifications from the blockchain and business logic.
- **Admin Panel:** Provides tools for manual overrides, KYC reviews, analytics, and audit log access.

---

## Workflow Descriptions

### User Onboarding & KYC

1. **Registration & KYC Upload:** Users sign up and upload necessary documents via the mobile app.
2. **API Gateway Processing:** Requests are authenticated and forwarded to Core Business Logic.
3. **KYC Verification:** Core Business Logic interacts with a KYC provider; verification results are stored and reviewed if needed.
4. **Account Activation:** Once KYC is approved, the user account is activated and linked to the abstracted wallet system.

### Token Purchase Flow

1. **Initiate Purchase:** Users select a property investment and initiate a token purchase from the dashboard.
2. **Request Handling:** The request passes through the API Gateway to the Core Business Logicâ€™s Token Purchase Manager.
3. **Blockchain Interaction:**
    - The Blockchain Orchestration Module selects either Polygon or Solana based on current conditions.
    - The Smart Contract Wrapper calls the appropriate smart contract to mint the token.
4. **Database Update & Notification:** The minted token is recorded in MongoDB and the userâ€™s portfolio is updated with a notification.

### Payout Flow

1. **Payout Request:** Users request a payout via the mobile dashboard.
2. **Validation & Processing:** The request is processed by the Core Business Logicâ€™s Payout Manager.
3. **External Payout:** The payout is executed via PayPal, and confirmation is received.
4. **Logging & Notification:** The transaction is logged in Postgres and the user is notified of the completed payout.

## Implementation Considerations

- **SDKs & Libraries:**
  - *Polygon:* Use [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) or [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js).
  - *Solana:* Utilize [@solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js).
- **Development Tools:** Use Truffle/Hardhat for Polygon, and Anchor for Solana program development.
- **Testing & Auditing:** Test smart contracts using Ganache (Polygon) and solana-test-validator (Solana); perform third-party audits.
- **Deployment Pipelines:** Implement CI/CD for automated testing and deployment of smart contracts.
- **Monitoring & Fallback:** Use network monitoring tools and automated fallback mechanisms to switch between Polygon and Solana as needed.

## Final Notes

By abstracting the blockchain and wallet complexities behind a unified API, WeHive delivers a user-friendly, secure, and efficient investment platform. Users enjoy a web2-like experienceâ€”registering, investing, and receiving payoutsâ€”while the platform manages complex tokenization, blockchain operations, and fiat integrations in the background.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, system architects, and stakeholders involved in the design, implementation, and maintenance of the WeHive platform.
